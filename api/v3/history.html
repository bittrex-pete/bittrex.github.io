                            <p>We are thrilled to announce that the v3 Beta API is now available to the public! This brand new API adds the most-requested features in a single API. Some of the highlights include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Market orders to buy/sell a quantity of a currency at the best, currently available price</li>
                                <li>Post-only orders which allow market makers to ensure their orders are making it to the order book instead of matching with a preexisting order</li>
                                <li>Fill or Kill and Immediate or Cancel order types which force orders to be filled immediately or not at all</li>
                                <li>Client-specified order IDs for easier tracking of orders and idempotency of order placement</li>
                                <li>More details are available about the status of deposits and withdrawals</li>
                                <li>Full history of your orders and withdrawals (not just most recent 20 or 200)</li>
                                <li>Changed how market identifiers are structured to better align with foreign exchange trading standards (for example, the market formally known as BTC-ADA is now ADA-BTC in the v3 API)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Reaching the Beta milestone represents our confidence in the quality and stability of our new API, but we're not done adding features. You can look forward to us adding even more to this API in upcoming releases.</p>
